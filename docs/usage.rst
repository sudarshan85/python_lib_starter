Package Usage
-------------

The recommended way to use this package to jumpstart your Python library
development is as follows:

1. Download (not clone) this repository and unpack it to a local folder.
2. Rename the ``starter`` module with the name of your library.
3. Replace references to ``starter`` in ``README.md``,
   ``environment.yml``, ``setup.py``, ``tests/test_main.py``,
   ``main.py``, ``Makefile``, and ``docs/conf.py``.
4. Replace ``startit`` in ``setup.py`` to the name of your library.
5. Rename ``starter.rst`` to your library name (with ``.rst`` as
   extenstion).
6. Replace references to ``starter`` in ``modules.rst``, ``install.rst``
   and other ``rst`` files with your library name that you just renamed.
7. Populate ``index.rst`` with the documentation about your library.
8. Delete ``usage.rst`` and remove its reference in index.rst.
9. Follow the installation instructions.

Module Usage
------------

In ``setup.py`` we have set ``entry_points`` with ``startit`` as the
command point to the ``entry_point`` function in ``main.py``. To make
sure the package works, after installing the package, you can run
``startit -n Code``. This will return **Hello World! My name is Code**.
Once you've replaced ``startit`` with the name of your library, you can
use that to launch the code. From there you can develop your package as
you want.
