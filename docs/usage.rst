Usage
=====

The recommended way to use this package to jumpstart your Python library
development is as follows:

1. Download (not clone) this repository and unpack it to a local folder.
2. Rename the ``starter`` module with the name of your library.
3. Replace references to ``starter`` in ``README.md``, ``environment.yml``,
   ``setup.py``, ``tests/test_main.py``, ``main.py``, ``Makefile``, and
   ``docs/conf.py``.
4. Rename ``starter.rst`` to your library name (with ``.rst`` as
   extenstion).
5. Replace references to ``starter`` in ``modules.rst``, ``install.rst``
   and other ``rst`` files with your library name that you just renamed.
6. Populate ``index.rst`` with the documentation about your library.
7. Delete ``usage.rst`` and remove its reference in `index.rst`.
8. Follow the installation instructions.

You can then push this to your remote Git repository for further
development.
